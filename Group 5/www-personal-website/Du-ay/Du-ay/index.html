                                            <p style="color: white;">Jerick Duay was born on March 20, 2006, in the quiet town of E.B. Magalona, Negros Occidental. He spent his formative years there, attending E.B. Magalona Elementary School from kindergarten up to grade 4. His childhood was filled with memories of life in the province, where he built strong friendships and developed a love for learning. However, in grade 5, his life took a significant turn when he and his family migrated to Manila. Adjusting to life in the bustling city, Jerick continued his education at San Agustin Elementary School, where he completed grades 5 and 6. These experiences taught him resilience and adaptability, as he transitioned from his rural hometown to the fast-paced urban life of Manila. After finishing elementary school, he enrolled in Novaliches High School, where he thrived academically and socially. In senior high school, he chose the STEM strand, focusing on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, which helped him lay a solid foundation for his future in the IT field. He graduated from Novaliches High School with a sense of accomplishment, ready to take on the challenges of higher education.</p>

                                                <p>Jerick Du-ay was born on March 20, 2006, in E.B. Magalona, Negros Occidental. His early years were spent in this quiet provincial town, where he began his education. In 2012, he entered E.B. Magalona Elementary School, starting from kindergarten and continuing up to grade 4. During this time, Jerick was deeply involved in his local community, enjoying the laid-back lifestyle and forming strong friendships. However, in 2016, his life took a significant turn when his family decided to migrate to Manila. This change led him to enroll in San Agustin Elementary School, where he completed grades 5 and 6. The shift from the rural life of Negros to the fast-paced urban environment of Manila was a challenging adjustment, but Jerick showed resilience and adaptability, excelling in his studies.</p>
